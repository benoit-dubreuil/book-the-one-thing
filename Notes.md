  - *Multitasking takes a toll.*

### Chapter 6
##### A Disciplined Life
- *Success is actually a short race—a sprint fueled by discipline just long enough for habit to kick in and take over.*
- *You can become successful with less discipline than you think, for one simple reason: success is about doing the right thing, not about doing everything right.*
- *When you do the right thing, it can liberate you from having to monitor everything.*
- *It takes an average of 66 days to acquire a new habit.*

##### A Balanced Life
- *Attend to all things, everything gets shortchanged.*
- *Magic happens at the extremes.*
- *When you gamble with your time, you may be placing a bet you can’t cover.*
- *To achieve an extraordinary result you must choose what matters most and give it all the time it demands. This requires getting extremely out of balance in relation to all other work issues, with only infrequent counterbalancing to address them.*
- *When you act on your priority, you’ll automatically go out of balance, giving more time to one thing over another.*
  - *Think about two balancing buckets.*
  - *Counterbalance your work bucket.*
  - *Counterbalance your personal life bucket.*

### Chapter 10
##### The Focusing Question
- *The quality of any answer is directly determined by the quality of the question.*
- *How we phrase the questions we ask ourselves determines the answers that eventually become our life.*
